# STAT-245 Data Analysis Project Summary
## Part 1 - Familiarize Yourselves with World Renew Project Data 

As we discussed, your group is going to be doing some comparative analysis that stems from data that were collected from a Sustainable Livelihoods program that World Renew implemented through local partner organizations in 5 countries (Mozambique, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Mali and Honduras).  This program was funded by Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and implemented from October 2012 to January 2018.  World Renew has provided you with baseline and endline data from the overall program (see below attachment that's labeled as "Final Livelihoods Program Performance Results"), as well as the data analysis that was completed in December 2017 and January 2018 as part of the final evaluation (both the trend analysis and regression analysis that was done for the two countries - Mozambique and Bangladesh - that you will be focusing on are included in the "GAC Livelihoods Program Materials" folder below).  I recommend that all of you take a look through the World Renew project data and analysis right away so you can decide which part of the comparative analysis work you want to focus on (below).

I have also provided some information that's related to the electronic data collection methods that we used to collect the survey data in the folder that's labeled "IT - Mobile Data Collection" because I could tell that it was a topic that all of you seemed to be interested in learning more about.  You won't need to use any of the information in the "IT - Mobile Data Collection" folder in order to complete your assignment, but I encourage you to look through it when you have a chance so you can learn a bit more about current methods that are being used to collect survey data from international development programs electronically.  I will also be happy to try and schedule a follow-up meeting later this semester if you'd like to learn more about how mobile data collection is being used for survey data collection in the international development field.  

## Part 2 - Comparative Data Analysis
Once you've had a chance to familiarize yourselves with the existing data and analysis from our completed World Renew Livelihoods project (aka "GAC Livelihoods" project), I recommend that you divide into two groups of two students each to tackle the comparative data analysis work that we'd like to have you focus on this semester.  

### A. Bangladesh Comparative Analysis
One group of students will need to compare the results that World Renew's "GAC-Livelihoods" program achieved in Bangladesh with 2011 and 2015 Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) data.  The BIHS is a national dataset that includes regionally-representative household-level data from the same areas of Bangladesh where our "GAC-Livelihoods" program operated.  Since the BIHS data are from the same geographic areas as the World Renew Livelihoods program, and they are also from roughly the same time interval (World Renew's program baseline was taken between October and December 2012, and the endline was taken roughly five years' later, in Fall 2017), World Renew's hope is that the analysis of BIHS data will enable you to see to what extent there were broader changes taking place in the communities where World Renew's partners worked that influenced our observed results (for example, extreme weather events that impacted food security or broad increases in economic growth that caused household incomes to rise independently of the impact that our savings group training had on household incomes).  I believe that the "difference in difference" estimation technique could be helpful with the work that needs to be done to figure out how much of the observed change in World Renew's program can be explained by changes that were occurring to the BIHS comparison groups in the same areas, so I've provided a link to the handout that I passed out when you visited World Renew last week. I will be happy to come over to Calvin and meet with you and Professor DeRuiter as well if you have additional questions that you'd like to go over regarding the "difference in difference" estimation technique.

The below folder contains the filtered BIHS data that you will be able to use for the comparative analysis as well as copies of the BIHS' questionnaires and a description of the BIHS itself.  Given that there are a lot of different variables in the BIHS, my recommendation would be to try and start by identifying BIHS variables that align with the food security, farmer training and savings group portion of the GAC-Livelihoods program and do that comparative analysis first. 

### B. Mozambique Comparative Analysis
A second group of students will need to focus on comparing the results that World Renew's "GAC-Livelihoods" program achieved in Mozambique with the results of the "Mozambique Cell Phone Project."  The Mozambique Cell Phone Project was implemented in a neighboring province to the area where the "GAC-Livelihoods" program was implemented, and it also used farmer training and savings groups to promote improved livelihoods for these farmers. Both projects ended up starting at roughly the same time as well (although the baseline for the "GAC-Livelihoods" program was taken in late 2012, the start of program implementation was delayed until 2014, so it's fair to say that both the Mozambique Cell Phone Project and the Mozambique portion of the GAC-Livelihoods program started implementation in 2014).  The endline for the Mozambique Cell Phone Project occurred in 2015, however, whereas the endline for World Renew's "GAC-Livelihoods" program was taken in October 2017.  The Mozambique Cell Phone Project also incorporated a technology-based component (mobile money) into its work with savings groups, while the "GAC-Livelihoods" program did not.  

World Renew is interested in exploring ways that increased use of technology might benefit our programs, so we are eager to see a comparative analysis of the results from the portions of the "GAC-Livelihoods" program survey that applied to farmer and savings group participants with the results that the Mozambique Cell Phone Project achieved in these same areas.  Since the Mozambique Cell Phone Project endline was completed roughly two years before the time that the "GAC-Livelihoods" program endline survey was completed, we would typically expect to see less change in the indicators for food security and income resilience from the Cell Phone Project because the project hadn't been running as long, but if your group finds a similar or even greater amount of change in the household well-being between the baseline and endline for the Mozambique Cell Phone Project even though it operated for a shorter time, this is something that would be of particular interest to World Renew.  We would be eager to see regressions run on the Mozambique Cell Phone Project data that explore whether similar, or different forces, were contributing to that project's observed change in household food security, farming and income sources from what World Renew found from the regressions that were completed on the "GAC-Livelihoods" endline data from Mozambique in January 2018.
