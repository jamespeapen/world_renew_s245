## Introduction 
![](WR_logos-1.png)

World Renew wanted an analysis of the effectiveness of their programs in Bangladesh that were aimed at improving food security. 

## GAC Livelihoods

## BIHS
The Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey is a survey of households across the country that includes variables about: 

 - Food security
 - Women's empowerment
 - Household assets
 - Literacy and education
 - Climate conditions
 
We had data from 2011 to 2015 which was the same time period that World Renew had their programs.

They wanted us to see whether an external dataset reflected any changes that could be attributed to the program.
