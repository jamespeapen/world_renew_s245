## Introduction
\n
![](WR_logos-1.png)
\n
World Renew wanted an analysis of the effectiveness of their programs in Bangladesh that were aimed at improving food security.

## Sustainable Livelihoods Program
    - A program implemented by World Renew in five countries to enhance livelihood security for vulnerable households from 2012 to 2017.
    - Three main focus of the programThree main focuses of the program: Food Security, Sustainable Economic Growth, Community Governance Capacity
    

## Questions
How is food security affected by assets and demographicsby assets and demographics?  
\n
Assets include : farming equipment, livestock and electronics.  
\n
Demographics include : gender, year, number of household members, literacy, and measures and climate conditions measures.

## BIHS
The Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey is a survey of households across the country that includes variables about:

 - Food security
 - Women's empowerment
 - Household assets
 - Literacy and education
 - Climate conditions
 
We had data from 2011 to 2015 which was the same time period that World Renew had their programs.
\n
They wanted us to see whether an external dataset reflected any changes that could be attributed to the program.




## Exploratory Plots

```{r, warning = FALSE}
gf_boxplot(data = bihs, fcs ~ house_owned)

gf_boxplot(data = bihs, fcs ~ asset_cartplough)
gf_boxplot(data = bihs, fcs ~ asset_tractor)
gf_boxplot(data = bihs, fcs ~ asset_motorbike)
gf_boxplot(data = bihs, fcs ~ asset_telephone)
gf_boxplot(data = bihs, fcs ~ asset_radio)
```

## Models

```{r}
bihs_lm <- lm(data = bihs_original, fcs ~ factor(survey_year) + asset_qty_poultry + asset_qty_cattle + asset_qty_otherlivestock + asset_qty_sheepgoat + memb_total + memb_und15 + memb_15_44 + hhs_total + bio_bio_1 + bio_bio_12 + house_owned + asset_cartplough + asset_telephone)

summary(bihs_lm)
vif(bihs_lm)
```


## Figures


## Challenges
\n
Some of the categorical variables values do not have much variation which does not allow us to model the regression successfully (e.g. assets_poultry, there were a lot of people who don’t have poultry which is recorded as 0, not much variation within the values)Some of the categorical variables values do not have much variation
There might be some combination of values of categorical predictors that don’t exist 
Categorical variable such as hhs_education has too many categories
Variables might have incomplete possible values
There are some combination of values of categorical predictors that don’t exist 

## Actions in Plan of Action
\n
Fit all the quantitative variables first, then add categorical variables one by one 
Figure out which variable cause the problem 
Change to numeric variables
Delete variables
Collapse variables together
Cut down on the number of categories for variables
